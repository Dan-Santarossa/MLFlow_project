# MLFlow_project

A developer has expressed an interest in the open source MLFlow tool and has asked you to setup a proof of concept (PoC) server in AWS so they can experiment with the user interface and features. MLFlow is available here: https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/tree/v1.30.0
 
Your task is to design and deploy an environment to host the MLFlow server in AWS including any required networking components. 
 
1. Your design should use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates in either Terraform or Cloudformation. 
2. Your design should include a Bash or PowerShell script to deploy the environment to AWS from a Windows, Linux or Mac workstation. 
3. Your IaC template files and deployment script should be accompanied with a PlayBook or written document providing an overview of the design. 
4. Your assignment should be published to a repo on your own personal GitHub account. 
 
As this environment is only designed for PoC, monitoring, health checks and high availability are not required however it is still a good idea to adhere to best principles for DevOps, security and infrastructure design as much as possible. The AWS services you choose to use are entirely up to you so please be as creative as you like.
